Simple Keylogger using python Creating a keylogger involves interacting with low-level system events to capture keystrokes. However, it's important to note that using keyloggers without explicit consent from users can raise ethical and legal concerns and may violate privacy rights. Therefore, keyloggers should only be used for legitimate purposes, such as debugging or monitoring authorized activities with proper permissions.

Before running this code, ensure you have the pynput library installed (pip install pynput). This code sets up a listener to capture keyboard events. Each time a key is pressed, the on_press callback function is triggered, which appends the pressed key to the specified log file. The listener continues running until the 'Esc' key is pressed, at which point the program stops.

Remember to handle ethical considerations and obtain appropriate permissions before using or deploying a keylogger. Unauthorized use of keyloggers can lead to serious legal and privacy issues
